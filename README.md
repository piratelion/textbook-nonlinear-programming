Solution trials for Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms
3rdEd, M.S. Bazaraa et.

## Introduction:
This is one of my self-study byproducts.
Due to the limitation of time, only the first 8 section has been read and 
hence there would be only offered the 2-8 sections' last question for each section.

Both tex and pdf are offered.
I would update soon.
